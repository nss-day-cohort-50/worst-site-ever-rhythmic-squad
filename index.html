            <strong>5 Stars!</strong>I was served as scone by Jean-Paul himself
            and told it would be "magical". The taste of mushroom and mold was
            awful, but I went on to found a small tech company called Apple!
            -Steve

          <li>
            <strong>1 Star!</strong>Pastry was drier than the Sahara Desert. I
            was so angry I decided to steal money from working class people.
            -Bob from Enron
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.14 Stars!</strong>Thanks to Jean-Paul the Pi I ate gave me
            and abstract view of what a bakery could be.
