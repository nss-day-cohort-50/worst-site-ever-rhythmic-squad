                    <li><strong>1 Star!</strong>Pastry was drier than the Sahara Desert.  I was so angry I decided to steal money from working class people. -Bob from Enron</li>
                    <li><strong>3.14 Stars!</strong>Thanks to Jean-Paul the Pi I ate gave me and abstract view of what a bakery could be.</li>
